      # Secret resource that will be used to store the account's private key.

      # the secret. If you lose this identity/secret, you will be able to
      # generate a new one and generate certificates for any/all domains
      # managed using your previous account, but you will be unable to revoke
      # any certificates generated using that previous account.
