# homelab

This is a repo containing all of my homelab configurations.

## Docker

Contains Docker Compose files and Dockerfiles for running containerized applications in the homelab. This is primarily for test/development functions as all production workloads have been moved to K8s.

## Kubernetes

Includes Kubernetes manifests for namespaces, deployments, services, and gateway configurations. Also contains scripts for setting up and managing the Kubernetes cluster.

## Scripts

Utility scripts for automating tasks such as infrastructure setup, backups, and monitoring.

## Terraform

Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing cloud or on-premise infrastructure for the homelab.
